# Architecture notes

Non-obvious constraints, quirks, and invariants that a reader cannot derive from the code alone. Numbered chronologically — never renumber.

Not decisions (those live in [`../adr/`](../adr/)) and not guides (those live in [`../guides/`](../guides/)). An item here describes *how the world is*, not *what we chose* or *how to do something*.
